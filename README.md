# Store Management System
# Overview
Developed a Store Management System in C++ to handle item entries, price retrieval, and deletions. The system manages up to 50 items, allowing users to input item IDs and prices, retrieve prices by ID, display items within a price range, and delete specific or all items. This project highlights skills in C++ programming, arrays, and control structures.
